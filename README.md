# AnimateSpriteSheetSlicer
Slices spritesheets exported from Adobe Animate in JSON-Array format into separate files.

Usage:

```
AnimateSpriteSheetSlicer <JSON-Array file path> <output directory>
```

If output directory argument is omitted, slices will be created in a directory named the same as the JSON-Array file, near that file.
